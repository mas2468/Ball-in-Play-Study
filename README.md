# Ball-in-Play-Study

This repository contains all the files for my first individual project in the field of football analytics, an area I have a keen casual interest in and also potentially in a professional capacity. It contains athe data set I created myself in excel for this project (as csv and xlsx files), the jupyter notebook I have written as the final result of the project itself (as ipynb and html files) and finally 20 png files of logos of the premier league clubs which are used in the notebook. To go through this project as an observer it is sufficient to simply read through the jupyter notebook I have created, and then if you have a further interest in the details take a further look at the dataset files and the picture files (the pictures are clearly not of that much interest).
